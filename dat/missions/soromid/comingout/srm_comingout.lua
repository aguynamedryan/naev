"It's a bit nerve-wracking, coming out to my parents, and I've met so many people who... anyway, it's nice to meet someone who understands and respects my wishes and doesn't react with sarcasm. I hope my parents understand...."
    After confirming that it's about the pronouns you use to refer to them, you simply say that it should be common decency to respect people's wishes regarding how they wish to be referred to. This leads to a conversation about common decency and people who do rude things for no good reason.]])

chatter[2] = _([[C perks up. "Can I tell you something?" You respond affirmatively. "Thank you," they say. "I was going to come out to my parents first, but I'm so nervous and... I feel safe coming out to you, you know? Since you've been so nice to me this entire time.
    "I was assigned male at birth, and society tends to see me as a man. But I've come to the conclusion that... I'm transgender. I feel like I should be... a woman, I think? I'm not sure. Does... does that make sense? I'm not being ridiculous, am I?" You respond that, no, they're not ridiculous; everyone is different and no one can know C better than they can. C seems relieved to hear this.]])

chatter[3] = _([["Hey... is there any chance, um... I know I asked you to use they/them pronouns for me before, but could you use she/her pronouns instead, please? I hope that's not too much trouble...." You assure her that it's no trouble at all and the two of you have a rather long and interesting conversation about the place of pronouns in society. You can tell that she's a lot happier and more comfortable than she was before.]])

chatter[5] = _([[You and Chelsea have a long conversation about ships and piloting. It turns out that she's quite interested in the subject and has aspirations of being a mercenary some day.

reminders[5] = _("Somehow, you and Chelsea get into a discussion about drinks that each of you likes and dislikes, and stories of bars you've been to throughout the galaxy.")
reminders[6] = _("Chelsea dozes off in a chair for a few hectoseconds before waking up with a yawn, prompting you to yawn as well.")

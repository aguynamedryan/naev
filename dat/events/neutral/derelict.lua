However, there is one console that is still operational. It appears to be running an ancient computer game about space exploration, trade and combat. Intrigued, you decide to give the game a try, and before long you find yourself hooked on it. You spend many fun periods hauling cargo, upgrading your ship, fighting enemies and exploring the universe. But of course you can't stay here forever. You regretfully leave the game behind and return to the reality of your everyday life.]]),

Hoping to find some information that could be of use to you, you decide to play back the most recent entries.

There are cute plushies hanging from the doorways, drapes on every viewport, coloured pillows in the corners of most compartments and cheerful graffiti on almost all the walls. A scan of the ship's computer shows that this ship belonged to a trio of adventurous young ladies who decided to have a wonderful trip through space. Sadly, it turned out none of them really knew how to fly a space ship, and so they ended up stranded and had to be rescued. Shaking your head, you return to your own ship.]]),

As soon as you step aboard you fall upwards and onto the ceiling, getting some nasty bruises in the process. Annoyed, you search the ship, but without result. You return to your ship - but forget about the polarised gravity at the airlock, so you again smack against the deck plates.]]),

"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "

"squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and "
"Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be "
"assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000m. Their security clearance code will be "

"core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly "
"away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"

#. -- 4. Player goes back to bar, comment how some have been trying to sell some ship scrap, apparently from Zerantix. Player told to follow scavengers.
#. -- 5. Scavengers show up and talk about sensors not working well, talk through broadcast. Player has to follow without getting too close (maybe needs outfits to improve sensor range in nebula?)
#. -- 6. They lead the player to some debris and start looting. Player gets to talk to them and convince to leave, or kill them. Learns that Za'lek have been buying the goods.

#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. MISSION: Defend the System 2
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. this mission begins with the frenetic Nasin wanting to escape
#. The Wringer due to being overwhelmed by House Sirius. The player
#. loads up with as many Nasin as their vessel will carry, and takes
#. them to seek refuge in the ingot system on planet Ulios, where they
#. begin to rebuild and plan.... (ominous music).
#. this mission is designed to be the end of part 1, and is supposed
#. to be very hard, and slightly combat oriented, but more supposed to
#. involve smuggling elements.
#. luacheck: globals attacked lastsys misn_over takeoff (Hook functions passed by name)

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
#. Iterate to find outfits matching the size and property of the empty
#. core outfit slots.

#. The benefits of using it are easy internationalization and consistency with the rest of Naev.

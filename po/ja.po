#. Ideas
#. * Vampiric weapon that removes shield regen, but regenerates shield by doing damage.
#. * Hot-dog launcher (for sale after Reynir mission): does no damage, but has decent knockback and unique effect
#. * Money launcher: does fairly good damage, but runs mainly on credits instead of energy
#. * Mask of many faces: outfit that changes bonuses based on the dominant faction of the system you are in (needs event to handle changing outfit)
#. * Weapon that does double damage to the user if misses
#. * Weapon that damages the user each time it is shot (some percent only)
#. * Space mines! AOE damage that affects everyone, but they don't move (useful for missions too!)
#. * Something that modifies time compression as an active outfit
#. * Something that lowers damage all over but converts it all to disable (fwd_dam_as_dis)
#. --
#. Always available outfits
#. TODO add more
#. TODO add randomly chosen outfits, maybe conditioned on the current system or something?
#. Give mission rewards the player might not have for a reason
#. { "Racing Skills 2",          "Racing Trophy" }, -- This is redoable so no need to give it again
#. Special case: this mission has multiple endings, and only one gives the reward.
#. Start the merchant and unboard.

"that will make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"    \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the {sys} system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the "
"location of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your "
"mission will be complete.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "

"they've been disabled.\n"

"    \"We're dealing with a fully operational, heavily armed military "

"this is their biggest stronghold, we must assume this base is heavily armed, "
"and has a large complement of defensive spacecraft to defend it from attack. "
"We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"
"    The system schematic on the wall updates with a cluster of white Dvaered "

"will be joined by citizen {player}, who has volunteered to fight on behalf "
"of House Dvaered on this occasion.\" The officer nods at you, then continues "
"his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are "

"fight.\""

"strike force. At this time the number and composition of ships is unknown, "
"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "
"task as auxiliary escorts is to protect the strike force's flanks and "
"intercept any FLF ships attempting to target the Obstinate. Be advised that "
"the Obstinate will have limited anti-fighter armaments available, as most of "
"its hull is dedicated to fighter bays. The Obstinate must not be destroyed! "
"This is your paramount objective!\"\n"
"    On the wall, the red dots are intercepted by the white dots, and blink "
"out of existence. Then a second group of white dots appears near the Dvaered "
"logos, and moves towards the glowing disc.\n"
"    \"As soon as the FLF have exhausted their forces trying to "
"counterattack, the HDSF Obstinate will begin launching bombers. It is our "
"belief that the bombers alone will be able to take out the enemy base, but "

"will move in to provide fire support.\"\n"
"    The glowing disc on the wall fades out, leaving the Dvaered fleet alone "
"and victorious.\n"
"    \"That will be all. You have your orders. Report to your stations as per "

#. -- This is the 5th mission of the Frontier War Dvaered campaign.
#. -- The player has to secure a Dvaered Warlord Meeting.
#. -- Hamelsen lures out the player, while Strafer gets killed by a spy who runs away.
#. -- There are two parts in the mission : part 1 is mainly contemplative, and part 2 is tricky, with fights and so.
#.
#. Stages :
#. 0) Way to Dvaer Prime
#. 1) Briefing at Dvaer Prime and patrol around DHC
#. 2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)
#. 3) Taking off from Laars
#. 4) Land on Laars and get rewarded

"\"Both squadrons of the DHC station's space security force will be deployed "
"with a full range ships from Vendettas to Goddards. Those squadrons are the "
"'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be to control "
"medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our "
"squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and "
"Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be "
"assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000m. Their security clearance code will be "
"automatically requested and processed by the system we'll install in your "
"core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly "
"away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"
"   \"Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will, of course, "
"have to obey orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept "
"in reserve close to the station.\n"
"   \"Oh, and there is another thing I must warn you about: it's the "
"warlord's odd sense of humour. When they see a small ship close to their "
"Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your "
"direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots fend for their lives. "
"Dvaered law allows warlords to do so provided they can assure the High "
"Command that there was no hostile intention. That can be a bit annoying, "
"sometimes.\""

"things may have turned differently for her and he answers:\n"

"by extension, to be granted regal power over a region.\n"
"   \"In the Dvaered army, everybody starts as a raw soldier, no matter if "

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.

#. Mission: The one with the Runaway
#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?
#. Difficulty: relatively easy?

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
#. Iterate to find outfits matching the size and property of the empty
#. core outfit slots.
#. Nothing to fill the slots could be found.

#. Provides string formatting and interpolation facilities.
#. The benefits of using it are easy internationalization and consistency with the rest of Naev.
#. The number formatters handle plural forms in the user's language, digit separators, and abbreviations.
#. String interpolation (format.f) allows for named parameters ("Fly to {planet} in the {system} system"),
#. whereas string.format is positional ("Fly to %s in the %s system") and locks translators into the English word order.
